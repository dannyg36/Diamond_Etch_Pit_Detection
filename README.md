# Diamond Etch Pit Detection Tool

Qt-based application for automated analysis of etch pit defects on single-crystal diamond substrates.

## Overview

This tool provides fast, quantitative assessment of diamond substrate quality through image processing of optical microscope images. It calculates etch pit density and relative depth to determine if substrates meet quality requirements for subsequent MPCVD epitaxial growth.

## Features
- Automated image analysis of diamond surfaces
- Quantitative etch pit density and depth measurements
- Batch processing capability
- Validation against AFM measurements
